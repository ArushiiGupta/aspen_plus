# Aspen Plus Simulation and Optimization of Distillation Column for Propane and Iso-Butane Separation

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
A feed consisting of 40 mol% propane and 60 mol% iso-butane is to be separated using 
distillation. 
Feed flowrate is 1 kmol/sec which is available at a temperature of 322 K and 20 atm pressure, 
enters a distillation column that uses 32 number of stages, a total condenser, a kettle-type reboiler 
and double-pass sieve-type trays (tray spacing = 0.6094 m). The condenser is operating at 16.8 
atm and the stage-wise pressure drop being 0.0068 atm inside the column. Assume that the feed 
stage is situated in the middle of the column, molar distillate flowrate is 0.4 kmol/sec and molar 
reflux ratio is 2. 
However, the desired specification of the heavy key component in the distillate is 2 mol% and 
that of the light key component in the bottom is 1 mol%. 
Design a distillation column that will bring about the desired separation 

also find the following: 

a) Corresponding distillation column height and diameter 
b) Tabulate the effect of feed stage location on the reflux ratio, condenser and reboiler duties 
(Vary the feed stage location from 12 to 18 for the analysis) 
c) Report the feed stage location at which the reflux ratio, condenser and reboiler duties 
altogether were found to be minimum.
d) Plot the graphs of reflux ratio vs feed stage, condenser duty vs feed stage and reboiler 
duty vs feed stage
